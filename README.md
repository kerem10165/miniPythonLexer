For run the project please excecute run.sh file without any command line arguement.

You can put your test scripts in test folder. After that you have to compile the all project but run.sh does this for you.

After put the test script in test folder, you have to edit main.cpp. Change the std::ifstream infile("test/test.py"); to your file name("test/myTest.py") then enjoy :).
